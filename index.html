                <div class="message-paragraph">Mitra's children attended Madison neighborhood public schools, a charter school and an out-of-district public school. 
                    She has navigated the world of special education with Section 504 Plans and an Individual Education Plan (IEP). 
                    Her two oldest sons attend Arizona public universities and she has witnessed how our public school system prepared them for the rigors of college. 
                    These experiences have given Mitra a powerful first-hand education into the challenges parents face as they navigate a rather complicated educational system.

                    She serves on the governing board because she believes how students are educated today will substantially determine the kind of society we all live in tomorrow. 
                    After attracting new businesses to Arizona, Mitra knows first-hand that employers invest in communities that have a well educated workforce. 
                    Our society profits from better informed citizens and a highly skilled workforce.
